1. Need to finish the put method for book/author

Finish book repository class
- Currently getting an error that I think is connected to returning an Author type in my get method... It might also be because the data in the db is outdated to work with the author type.

Finish Repository classes for Author, Book

Get rid of warnings

Waiting to get into test class a little before creating Tests for User, Author, book


Waiting until finishing many-to-many video to do anything with UserToBook
